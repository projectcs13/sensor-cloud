I decided to use python 3 together with requests library as i found it
to be the easiest way to perform restful tests on.

Required to run this file
- Python 3 . 
- 'Requests' library installed on local machine.

To install Python 3 open the terminal and type

	sudo apt-get install python3

Then invoke the new Python 3 shell using

	python3

To install 'Requests' library for making http requests
go to this site

	http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install

Download the zipball and extract the contents

$ curl -OL https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/zipball/master

cd into that directory and run

$ sudo python3 setup.py install

After that you are ready to run your testfile
to do that, cd into the directory were your test lies
and run the command : 

$ python3 -m unittest ENTER TEST NAME HERE.py
